# 2. Make a Laravel Package

Add the following section in `composer.json` to make the package work with Laravel.
```
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "providers": [
            "GoodSystem\\GoodSystemServiceProvider"
        ]
    }
}
```

And create `src/GoodSystemServiceProvider.php` following [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/packages).

Begin with just a route

```
public function boot()
{
    $this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'/routes.php');
}
```

And of course, create `routes.php`

```
<?php
// A test route.  This is to be removed later
Route::get('/test', function () {
    return "GOOD SYSTEM";
});
```
